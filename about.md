<p>Open-source Social Engineering Education Course</p>
<p>Written and created by: <a href="https://c1ph0r.github.io/">Edward Miro - Associate Faculty, Butte College</a></p>
<br>
This course was designed as a framework to facilitate what I see as the most logical and effective way to learn about social engineering. In the following pages you will find a proposed 15 week schedule that can be easily adapted to be taught in a standard college semester. I leave it open enough to allow instructors to adapt and change to suit their particular needs and constraints. It can also be used by hacker meetup groups as a springboard for any trainings they want to offer their members, and also useful for the solo learner. 
<br><br>
Students will be guided through the study of 3 integral texts in this area: 
<li><p>Carnegie, Dale. <u>How to Win Friends and Influence People</u>. Simon and Schuster, 2009.</p></li> 
<li><p>Dreeke, Robin, et al. <u>The Code of Trust: an American Counterintelligence Expert&#39;s Five Rules to Lead and Succeed</u>. St. Martins Griffin, 2019.</p></li> 
<li><p>Hadnagy, Christopher. <u>Social Engineering: the Science of Human Hacking</u>. Wiley, 2018.</p></li> 
As students progress through each required reading, written responses and exercises will be included to reinforce the learning and give them an opportunity to get hands on experience.
