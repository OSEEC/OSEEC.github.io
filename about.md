<p>Open-source Social Engineering Education Course</p>
<p>Written and created by: <a href="https://c1ph0r.github.io/">Edward Miro - Associate Faculty, Butte College</a></p>
<br><br>
This course was designed as a framework to facilitate what I see as the most logical and effective way to learn about social engineering. In the following pages you will find a proposed 15 week schedule that can be easily adapted to be taught in a standard college semester. I leave it open enough to allow instructors to adapt and change to suit their particular needs and constraints. It can also be used by hacker meetup groups as a springboard for any trainings they want to offer their members, and also useful for the solo learner.
