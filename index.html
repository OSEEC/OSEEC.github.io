As you read the words “social engineering” what thoughts or images does that conjure? 
<br><br>
If you’re not a hacker or IT professional you might think of politics, manipulation, or the media. Indeed some of the ideas behind these concepts here are adjacent to what we mean in the information security world when we say “social engineering”. 
<br><br>
SE in our context is:
<br><br>
Exploiting human psychology to gain access to unauthorized access, data or information.
<br><br>
Social engineering has and always will be the most common attack vector.<br><br>Consider this:<br><br>
<a href="https://www.graphus.ai/verizon-says-phishing-still-drives-90-of-cybersecurity-breaches/">“Verizon’s analysis of 1600 cybersecurity incidents and 800 breaches found that phishing was involved in 90% of successful attacks.”</a>
<br><br>
The only way to combat this threat is through awareness training and testing. 
<br><br>
This course was conceptualized, designed and implemented with the following principles as  major motivations: open-source education, accessibility, and a personal passion for the study of social engineering. 
<br><br>
<li>Open-source education: Knowledge should be freely available to those who seek it. While not intending to be a replacement for paid training, it does address the reality that not everyone can afford commercial training.</li><br>
<li>Accessibility: this course should be just as useful for a college teacher, technical trainer, or for self study. Also, a lot of SE books and training start from the assumption of having basic social skills. No training or techniques will be effective if you lack those basic soft skills. This course strives to provide that foundation.</li><br>
<li>Passion: I have dedicated my personal professional focus to the study and analysis of social engineering. The pursuit of this knowledge and these skills have gone much deeper than mere tricks and cons. These are skills for life and I owe my success to this and want to share what I've learned to help others.</li><br>
