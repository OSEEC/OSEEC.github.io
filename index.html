<h1>Welcome to OSEEC</h1><br><br>
<h2>The Open-source Social Engineering Education Course</h2>
<br><br>
As you read the words “social engineering” what thoughts or images does that conjure? 
<br><br>
If you’re not a hacker or IT professional you might think of politics, manipulation, or the media. Indeed some of the concepts behind these thoughts here are adjacent to what we mean in the information security world when we say “social engineering”. 
<br><br>
SE in our context is:
<br><br>
Exploiting human psychology to gain access to gain unauthorized access, data or information.
<br><br>
Social engineering has and always will be the most common attack vector. Consider this:<br><br>
<a href="https://www.graphus.ai/verizon-says-phishing-still-drives-90-of-cybersecurity-breaches/">“Verizon’s analysis of 1600 cybersecurity incidents and 800 breaches found that phishing was involved in 90% of successful attacks.”</a>
<br><br>
The only way to combat this threat is through awareness training and testing. 
<br><br>
This course was conceptualized, designed and implemented with the following principles as  major motivations: open-source education, accessibility, and a personal passion for the study of social engineering. 
<br><br>
* Open-source education: knowledge should be freely available to those who seek it. 
<br><br>
* Accessibility: this course should be just as useful for a college teacher, technical trainer, or for self study. 
<br><br>
* Passion: I have dedicated my personal professional focus to the study and analysis of social engineering.
